# Contribution guidelines

## How can I contribute?

1. [Reporting bugs or feature ideas](https://github.com/Lieturd/aperture-control/issues): It's definitely helpful to know what kind of problems people are having, or would like to see solved. Even if you yourself don't know the solutions, someone else might come up with one.
2. Creating recipes to the [Aperture Control Recipes](https://github.com/Lieturd/aperture-control-recipes) -collection
3. Spreading the word: The more people know of Aperture Control, the more time we save together, and the more likely it is for us to find more people able and willing to contribute more useful things.
4. Testing the recipes: See if the contributions work for you, and report if they don't.
